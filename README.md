# corstest
Having some problems with cors, cookies and express-session, so I've set up two minimal servers here that contains the bare minimum of cors. It contains of two servers, 8033, which is the API server, and 8043, which is the client server. It's tested on Node.js v6.9.1, and should work fine.
